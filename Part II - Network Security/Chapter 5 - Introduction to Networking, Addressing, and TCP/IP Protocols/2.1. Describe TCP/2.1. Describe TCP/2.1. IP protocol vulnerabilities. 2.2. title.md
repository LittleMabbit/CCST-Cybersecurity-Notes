# The TCP/IP Stack
- It's also known as the Internet Protocol suite.
  - Think of it like a set of standardized blueprint that tells computers how to communicate.
  - It aids the better communications through the Internet and/or local networks, the different types of network too.
- Creation coming from a lot of collaborators, mainly from the Department of Defense and its Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
- The TCP/IP Stack consists of four layers, each one with a function assigned:
  - Application.
  - Transport.
  - Internet.
  - Link
- **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)**
  - Framework that standardizes and describes the functions of a communications system.
  - It's chosen as a theoretical system.
- **OSI Layers**
  - Application
  - Presentation
  - Session
  - Transport
  - Network
  - Data Link
  - Physical
- OSI Reference and the TCP/IP Suite.
  - Even though models are similar, we said OSI Model is a framework.
  - This framework amalgamates its own layers into the ones used for the TCP/IP Model.
    - Application, Presentation and Session ---> Application
    - Transport ---> Transport
    - Network ---> Internet
    - Data Link and Physical ---> Link.

## TCP/IP Stack Application Layer
- Application Layer - Stands at the top of the TCP/IP Stack. It serves the communication between applications on a network. HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS are examples of protocols that operates at this layer.
- Presentation Layer - Responsible for data presentation. It has the skill to translate, encrypt and decrypt information between hosts. It can also handle compression and decompression.
- Session Layer - Establishes, manages and terminates communication between applications. Provides applications to establish, syncrhonize and agree on communication.

## TCP/IP Stack Transport Layer
- Transport Layer - Ensure reliable and unreliable, also efficient end-to-end data transmission between applications on different devices. TCP and UDP are the most used protocols in this layer.

## TCP/IP Stack Internet Layer
- Network Layer - Is where IP operates. Manages the routing and forwarding of packets in networks. IPv4 and IPv6 are the most used protocols.

## TCP/IP Stack Link Layer
- Data Link Layer - Responsible for transmission of data frames between nodes in a network and also the addressing of those frames. Provides error detection, flow control, data framing, etc.
- Physical Layer - Handles the physical transmission over different mediums, such as cables, wireless,  or other medias.

# Common TCP/IP Protocols and Their Vulnerabilities.
### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Offers reliable and connection-oriented transport.
- You find this protocol used in the Transport Layer from the TCP/IP suite.
- Makes sure that packets arrives their destination in the correct order, and accurately.
- Provides error correction, flow control, congestion control.
- Vulnerabilities associated with this protocol:
  - **TCP SYN flood attacks:** Attackers flood the target with SYN requests, opening listening ports and preventing legit users from establishing connections.
  - Mitigation: Implement firewall rules and limit the number of possible SYN requests.
  - **TCP Sequence Number Prediction:** Predict TCP connections that enables attackers to hijack TCP connections or inject malicious data.
  - Mitigation: Enforce randomization of TCP sequence number to prevent predictions.
  - **TCP Session Hijacking:** Attackers intercept and manipulate TCP packets to access unathorized data.
  - Mitigation: Employ data encryption and strong authentication mechanisms.

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Connectionless and lightweight transport protocol.
- Faster transmission of data between communicating devices.
- Although it does not provides reliablity and error-correction mechanisms of the TCP.
- Mostly used to connections that requires speed, such as Streaming, VoIP, DNS.
- Vulnerabilities associated with this protocol:
  - **UDP Flood Attacks:** Attackers flood the target with tons of UDP messages, congesting the network and potentially causing denial of service.
  - Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and detection of UDP packets cancellation to prevent this attack.
  - **UDP Amplification Attacks:** Exploiting of UDP vulnerabilities to generate a huge response to a small request and congest the network.
  - Mitigation: Configure networks to distable vulnerable UDP services.
  - **Lack of reliability:** UDP can't provide data retransmission of lost packets, or ordered delivery of packets.
  - Mitigation: Implementing error-detection and error-handling mechanisms at the application layer, like checksums or acknowledgment protocols.

### Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)
- Fourth version of the Internet Protocol.
- Manages forwarding and routing of packets through routers.
- Uses 32-bit addresses, almost 4.3 billion of unique addresses.
- Vulnerabilities associated with IPv4:
  - **IP Spoofing:** IP addresses can be easily spoofed. This leads to impersonation, unauthorized access, DDoS.
  - Mitigation: Implement packet filtering or ingress IP Source Guard at network boundaries to verify the authenticity of IP packets.
  - **IP Fragmentation Attacks:** Attackers abuse IP fragmentation systems to evade detection or cause exhaustion of systems.
  - Mitigation: Implement IP fragmentation controls and monitor for abnormal fragmentation patterns.
  - **Limited Address Space:** With only 4.3 billions of unique directions, it's hard to assign properly addresses to every device in a network.
  - Mitigation: Adopting IPv6, which offers a wider range of possible IP addresses.

### Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)
- Uses 128-bit addresses.
- Responsible for addressing and routing packets.
- Created to overcome the IPv4 lack of addresses.
- Vulnerabilities associated with IPv6:
  - **Increased Attack Surface:** IPv6 introduces a larger number of network addresses and additional features, which can increase the possible vulnerabilities of the protocol.
  - Mitigation: IDSs, network segmentation, firewall policies, etc.
  - **Address Scanning:** Attackers scan IPv6 address ranges to identify vulnerable systems and discover network topologies.
  - Mitigation: Implement network access control and continous monitoring of systems to detect scanning stages.
  - **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) Security:** Equivalent of the ARP from the IPv4 protocol. It is vulnerable to neighbor solicitation/advertisement spoofing and router advertisement spoofing.
  - Mitigation: Implement secure techniques such as secure neighbor discovery mechanisms, NDP snooping, ingress filtering, etc.
  - **Transition mechanisms:** Coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 introduces new challenges and potential vulnerabilities during the transition period.
  - Mitigation: Secure transition mechanisms that must be implemented during the coexistence of both protocols.

### Media Access Control (MAC)
- Unique identifiers assigned at the NICs at the Data Link Later.
- Facilitates the life of switches and packet forwarding to specific MAC addresses in a network.
- Vulnerabilities associated with the MAC:
  - **MAC Address Spoofing:** Attackers can spoof or change MAC address to impersonate legitimate devices. This can lead to unathorized access, network disruption, etc.
  - Mitigation: Implementing MAC Address filtering, port security, network access control mechanisms, etc.
  - **MAC Flooding:** Attackers flood the switch with a larged number of forged MAC addresses, causing the swwitch to enter fail-open mode, where it sends packets to all ports. This is known as a CAM table overflow and can cause DoS.
  - Mitigation: Implementing features such as MAC Address Limiting, Dynamic MAC Address aging, or switch port security.
  - **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** ARP Tables manipulation on Local Area Networks.

### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- Used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses in a network.
- It's a Data Link Protocol.
- Vulnerabilities associated with the ARP:
  - **ARP Spoofing:** Attackers forge or manipulate ARP tables to associate their own MAC address to legitimate IP addresses. This way you can modify or intercept network data.
  - Mitigation: Implementing mechanisms like ARP inspections and Dynamic ARP inspection.
  - **ARP Cache Poisoning:** Attackers send fake ARP requests to feed the ARP table with their own MAC addresses, this way redirecting traffic to themselves.
  - Mitigation: Configuring static ARP caching or limiting the time ARP caches can store information.

### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Application-layer protocol.
- Used to transmit and obtain web-based content.
- Enables communication between web clients and web servers.
- Vulnerabilities associated with HTTP:
  - **On-path attacks:** Attackers intercept HTTP data to eavesdrop and modify data being exchanged.
  - Mitigation: Implementing SSL/TLS to HTTP to encrypt data being exchanged.
  - **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious script/code into websites and users execute with unwillingly/unknowingly.
  - Mitigation: Employing input validation and output decoding to prevent XSS attacks.
  - **SQL Injection:** Malicious injection of SQL statements to HTTP(s) webpages that can result in data manipulation, data leakage, other data maliciously management.
  - Mitigation: Ingress input validation and sanitization. Perform quality assurance and testing to detect vulnerabilities.
  - **Cross-site request forgery:** Attackers trick users into performing certain malicious actions towards the target website. The users have certain rights over the website and attackers will take advantage of the trust relationship between the user and the web server.
  - Mitigation: Implementing anti-CSRF tokens and policies to prevent CSRF.

### Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Used primarily to detect issues on IP networks.
- Can be also used to test connectivity, or track paths to destinations.
- Vulnerabilities associated with ICMP:
  - **ICMP Flood Attacks:** Attackers flood the network with ICMP echo requests and causes DoS.
  - Mitigation: Applying rate limiting or mechanism to prevent or block ICMP echo requests in networks.
  - **ICMP Redirect Attacks:** Attackers send false ICMP redirect packets to disguise themselves against a trusted host, attracting packets to themselves as default gateways.
  - Mitigation: Configure devices to ignore ICMP redirect messages.

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Assigning IP addresses and full network configurations to devices connecting networks.
- Simplifies network configurations and reduces manual device management.
- Vulnerabilities associated with DHCP:
  - **DHCP Spoofing:** Attackers impersonate legitimate DHCP servers, provoding with fake and malicious parameters to devices requesting a configuration.
  - Mitigation: Implement DHCP snooping and DHCP server authentication.
  - **DHCP Starvation Attacks:** Attackers request as many configurations as possible to make the DHCP server run out of IP addresses and prevent legitimate users from doing DHCP requests.
  - Mitigation: Enforcing rate limits and leasing times to prevent the starvation.

### Domain Name System (DNS)
- Translates domain names to IP addresses.
  - This accomplishes connection from host to web servers.
- It's an application layer protocol.
- Vulnerabilities associated with DNS:
  - **DNS Spoofing:** Attackers manipulates DNS responses for malicious redirecting or modifies DNS queries.
  - Mitigation: Allow DNS filtering solutions and ingress DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)
  - **DNS Amplification Attacks:** Attackers will exploit DNS misconfigurations to amplify their attacks, causing network congestion and eventually DoS.
  - Mitigation: Ensure proper DNS configuration and prevent open DNS resolvers.

### File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Allows file transfering between devices.
- Provides standards for downloading, uploading and managing files.
- FTP is an application layer protocol.
- Vulnerabilities associated with FTP:
  - **Lack of encryption:** FTP transmit data in plaintext, which makes the protocol vulnerable to eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
  - Mitigation: Implemeting FTP oer SSL/TSL (FTPS) to secure data, or using the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), both providing data encryption.
  - **Weak authentication:** FTP relies on basic username and password authentication, which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
  - Mitigation: Enforce strong passwords, allow MFA, etc.
  - **Data tampering:** FTP does not provides integrity check, so traffic can't be checked.
  - Mitigation: Enforce the usage of checksums and digital signs to provide integrity.

### Telnet
- Established terminal remote connection with other devices.
- The connection is through the command line interface.
- It simplifies the remote access through this CLI.
- Vulnerabilities associated with Telnet:
  - **Lack of encryption:** Telnet exchanges data in plaintext.
  - Mitigation: Replace telnet with more secure protocols such as SSH.
  - **Weak authentication:** Relies on basic username and password credentials, which can be pressured for brute-force attacks.
  - Mitigation: Enforce strong passwords and allow MFA/2FA.
  - **On-path attacks:** Connections are susceptible to intruders in the network.
  - Mitigation: Use SSH or VPNs to encrypt data exchange.

### Secure Shell (SSH)
- Provides functionalities like Telnet.
  - Instead, it will encrypt all data exchange transmission.
- It allows the connection of remote terminals and file transfer (SFTP).
- SSH ensures CIA.
- Vulnerabilities associated with SSH:
  - **Weak Authentication:** SSH can be vulnerable to weak authentication techniques, such as poor short passwords or single authentication techniques.
  - Mitigation: Enforce strong password policies, and implement a policy regarding using MFA to log in.
  - **Vulnerabilities in SSH implementation:** SSH have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers.
  - Mitigation: Keeping SSH up to date with the latest security patches availables.
  - **Misconfigured access control:** Improperly configured access control can lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
  - Mitigation: Enforce firewall policies, harden access controls through SSH to prevent miscofingurations, network segmentation is also an option.

# Network Addressing and Its Impact on Security
### IPv4 and IPv6
- Addresses in a network allows devices to communicate accurately.
- Also, it's used by network administrators.
  - Monitor and secure traffic.
  - Monitor and secure network performance.
  - Detect potential threats.
  - Use Intrusion Prevention Systems and Intrusion Detection Systems.
- It's also used to control the access to a network.
  - Establish ACLs.
  - Configure firewalls.
  - Ingress solutions.
- Addresses must be unique.
- It opens the attack surface for threat actors.
  - Attackers can analyze, probe and attack addresses.
  - Addresses can be used as entry point of vulnerabilities.
  - It's crucial to implement security measures such as IDSs, network segmentation, access control configurations, etc.

### CIDR Notations
- Defines the notation used to define IP addresses and their prefix length.
  - For example: 192.168.0.0/24.
  - The /24 is the CIDR notation.
    - It describes that the first 24 bits of the address (32bits) establishes the network address.
    - The other 8 (24 - 32 = 8) are the bits that can be set to establish the host address.
- CIDR notation affects security heavily:
  - With CIDR, network administrators can segment the network into smaller pieces.
  - With this, you can handle plenty things such as:
    - Divide the network in zones that depends on the department handling traffic.
    - Easier monitoring of hosts and network traffic.
    - Access control implementations.
    - Firewalls options such as the DMZ or the ZPFs.
    - Isolate networks.
- CIDR notation is often utilized in ACLs.
  - With CIDR notation, you can specify certain rules, policies to granular IP addresses or sections.
  - You can specify that certain traffic is not allowed to reach 192.168.12.0/24 network segment.
- Also, CIDR helps with routing.
  - Routing protocols such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) use CIDR notations to make routing decisions.
  - By doing this, you can improve the network performance.
  - Also, ingress security mechanisms oriented to the routing-security.

### Network Segmentation
- Network segmentation is also called subnetworks/subnet.
  - By creating subnets you can reach network isolation.
  - With this, what happens in a subnet stays in that subnet.
  - And if one subnet is affected, it can't reach other subnets with proper segmentation and access controls.
- Subnetting is important:
  - With this you can manage IP allocation.
  - Manage subnet security based on the subnet utility.
  - Reduce network traffic.
  - Improve network performance.
  - Create security zones by subnet isolation.
  - Etc.
- VLANs are logical network segmentations that work at the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model.
  - VLANs allows logical segmentation of devices without caring about where they're located.
  - Devices inside a VLAN can communicate logically as if they were in the same VLAN group.
  - Also, different VLANs can only speak to each others by routing their packets using routers.
- KEEP IN MIND:
  - Network Segmentation improves network security.
  - Also improves network performance.
  - Lets you decide how would you allocate IPs in a network.
  - You can allocate them depending on what their goal is.
  - You can limit the risk or threat surface with ACLs, firewalls, policies.

### Public versus Private Networks
- Comparison between Public and Private Networks: Order is CHARACTERISTIC | PUBLIC NETWORK | PRIVATE NETWORK
  - **Addressing** - Public IPv4 addresses are from class A, B and C. IPv6 are unicast global addresses. - Private RFC 1918 addresses from class A, B and C For IPv4. Unique local IPv6 unicast addresses and link-local unique IPv6 unicast addresses. 
  - **Accessibility** - Public networks are accessible to the most of the public on the internet. Mostly provided by the Internet Service Provider - Private networks are restrictied to specific users from certain organizations.
  - **Ownership and control** - Public networks are managed and controlled by third party vendors such as the ISPs. - Private networks are controlled by the entities that owns them.
  - **Security**
    - Public Network:
      - Present increased security risks as they pose in a more natural environment.
      - Some of the attacks can be:
        - Increased Exposure: With open environments it's harder to control devices and the network itself. Also, it's a good target for cybercriminals to eavesdrop, intercept data, use packet sniffers, or even open malicious connections.
        - On-path Attacks: Open networks provides attackers with more opportunities to eavesdrop, capture and modify data or compromise data exchange.
        - Vulnerability to attacks: It's widely open to malicious attacks, phishing, malware injections and others; after all it's a hard-to-control network.
    - Private Network:
      - Controlled Access: You can have more control over the network connections, connected users, enforce policies and other security mechanisms over a network.
      - Network Segmentation: As mentioned before, you can segment and have more control over the network and with subnets, have a better handling of traffic.
      - Enhanced monitoring and management:  Network administrator can ingress security mechanisms such as IDS and IPS as the network can be controlled.

### NAT
- Network Address Translation.
  - It's a protocol that allows the translation between Private RFC 1918 Addresses to Public Addresses.
  - IP Addresses from the RFC 1918 can only communicate within private networks.
  - Connecting to the internet requires this protocol as it helps the requirement of connecting to Public Networks with Public Addresses possible.
- How it works:
  - You send a query or a packet to the internet.
  - Every packet has a source IP address and a public IP address.
  - The router is the main character here.
  - Your PC will send the packet to its default gateway (the router).
  - The router uses NAT to translate from private to public network.
  - The packet coming as a response from the public network must have your public assigned address.
  - Once the router receives this packet, it will translate the public address back to a private address.
  - Then the router will forward the packet to this private address.
- NAT is a security measure but it is not as safe as it can be think of.
  - It's a door between the private and the public network.
  - This door has flaws though that can be exploited by attackers.
  - You should not rely solely on NAT.
- NAT also works as some kind of Firewall.
  - NAT has stateful tables that holds information about active and expired sessions.
  - For example, the only allowed packets coming from the outside are the ones originated as a response from an insider request.
- Summary:
  - Conserves a table with Public IP.
  - Translating point between Private and Public networks.
  - Has implications in network security.
  - Introduces firewall functions, port-layered assignments, limits inbounds connections, hides private IP addresses.
  - It can form up part of the network security.
  - Yet, you must ingress stronger security mechanisms.

### PAT
- Port Address Translations.
  - Feature of the Network Address Translation Protocol.
  - Maps several private network addresses to the outside with only a few private network addresses available.
  - Imagine having 1000 private networks addresses and having only 10 public network addresses.
  - PAT will help you with that as it was just mentioned.

### MAC Addressing
- Operates at the Data Link Layer.
- It's the one in charge of communication between devices in the same subnet/VLAN/Network.
- MAC Addresses helps identify the associated Network Interface Card (NIC) with hosts.
- With this, you can achieve MAC address filtering and MAC-based access controls.
