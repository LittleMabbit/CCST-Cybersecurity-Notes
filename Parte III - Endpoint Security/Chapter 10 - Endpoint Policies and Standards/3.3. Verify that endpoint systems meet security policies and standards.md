# Asset Management
An enpoint is basically everything that connects to a network including laptops, computers, IOTs, workstations, mobiles, etc.

**KEY POINT:** Asset Management is the process of deploying, maintaining and decommissioning IT resources and assets, yet an asset is anything that poses a value to a company or organization. Important key factors about asset management that may help secure assets:
- Improved visibility - Have a better image about what is in and what is not inside a network.
- System maintenance - It's important to have all the resources patched with the latest security updates.
- Asset priorization - A complete evaluation and image of assets is the first step in evaluating the best asset controls and priorization.
- Better auditing and detection - A centralized database of assets on a baseline improves the network security quality by knowing which devices are authorized and approved to be where they are.
- Legal Exposure - Asset inventories help you with providing reqeuired regulations and avoiding lawsuits and fines.

You could keep track of assets in a spreadsheet the old way, but there are better methods such as using software designed to keep track and link endpoints together, potentially reducing costs. Also, it's important to keep a list of every endpoint or asset in a network for the following reasons:
- Vulnerability Management - Vulnerability scanners can't see all the network devices and endpoints of a network, neither their system version or firmware. Having a list on all of these characteristics easies your way into knowing the devices, systems and possible vulnerabilities each one has.
- Incident Response - Detecting, containing and eradicating incidents without having a proper or clean vision over the assets being protected might cause oversights during the IR process.
- Risk Assessment - You can't measure risk for hardware or software you are not aware of. Asset inventories help with this process to to help with measurement and priorization of risks.
