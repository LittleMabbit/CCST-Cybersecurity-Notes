# Asset Management
An endpoint is basically everything that connects to a network including laptops, computers, IOTs, workstations, mobiles, etc.

**KEY POINT:** Asset Management is the process of deploying, maintaining and decommissioning IT resources and assets, yet an asset is anything that poses a value to a company or organization. Important key factors about asset management that may help secure assets:
- Improved visibility - Have a better image about what is in and what is not inside a network.
- System maintenance - It's important to have all the resources patched with the latest security updates.
- Asset priorization - A complete evaluation and image of assets is the first step in evaluating the best asset controls and priorization.
- Better auditing and detection - A centralized database of assets on a baseline improves the network security quality by knowing which devices are authorized and approved to be where they are.
- Legal Exposure - Asset inventories help you with providing reqeuired regulations and avoiding lawsuits and fines.

You could keep track of assets in a spreadsheet the old way, but there are better methods such as using software designed to keep track and link endpoints together, potentially reducing costs. Also, it's important to keep a list of every endpoint or asset in a network for the following reasons:
- Vulnerability Management - Vulnerability scanners can't see all the network devices and endpoints of a network, neither their system version or firmware. Having a list on all of these characteristics easies your way into knowing the devices, systems and possible vulnerabilities each one has.
- Incident Response - Detecting, containing and eradicating incidents without having a proper or clean vision over the assets being protected might cause oversights during the IR process.
- Risk Assessment - You can't measure risk for hardware or software you are not aware of. Asset inventories help with this process to to help with measurement and priorization of risks.

# Program Deployment
Programs and software deployments can be performed either manually or automatically. As we know, every system has their own update installer such as Windows Update for Windows, the packet manager for Linux or the corresponding update software for MacOS. It can be hard to manually apply updates for each host at a time, so usually it is a better choice to go with automated deployments.

Automated deployments can be made through platform-specific and cross-platform tools:
- **Platform-specific tools:** Tools used to support certain/specific platform software from a single operating system, just like Windows offices might require their own tools to provide support to domain-joined Microsoft computers.
- **Platform-agnostic tools:** Tools used to support various software from a mixed environment of operating systems. Some tools are:
  - Mobile Device Management (MDM) - Enables the administration of mobile devices and also is capable of administrating desktop workstations or systems.
  - Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) - Allows IT service provides to connect, monitor and manage endpoints.

# Backups
A backup is a copy of storaged data in different places or locations to avoid losing a single set of data permanently. It can be made either locally or remotely

### Local and Remote Backups
**KEY POINT AHEAD** We can have backups either local or remotely storaged in safe places:
- Local Backups - These backups are in the same location that you currently are. Having a backup of your local computer to a hard drive is a local backup.
- Remote Backups - Key difference is that these backups are made remotely to other geographical locations, or in the cloud, basically far from your current location.

There are situations that vary from why or how you want to create your backups. Let's talk about the location first, with local backups you have a backup locally and instantly in your current location, where the remote backup is completely at other location.

Now *speed*, it's faster to create a backup when you're locally cloning the information that doing it over the internet as it should be done when using remote backup methods.

Also an important fact is the *disaster resistance* in which if local backup location experiences any type of disaster such as fire or water damage there's almost nothing you can do, it's easier for the local backup to be destroyed. At the other side, remote backups has a different location so in case of a disaster happening to the source location of the backup'd data, the remote location should be safe.

And last but not least, the *internet* factor is also there. Local backups don't require generally internet access where remote backups must use internet to connect to the remote backup location.

### Full, Differential and Incremental Backups
With full backups we're not deduplicating the data, meaning that data is saved from endpoints no matter what without checking for redundancy of data. Now with hundreds of data being duplicated it's easy to fill a 100GB of hard drive in days.

Because of this, we have differential and incremental backups. These works based on doing a full backup and then parcially doing backups of information depending on what's needed. A differential backup copies new data after the first full backup. Then, the incremental backup copies any new data after the first full backup or incremental backup.

# Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
**KEY POINT AHEAD** BYOD is a policy that allows inviduals of an organization to use their own equipment and devices for the job. This brings benefits to the employers and employees of an organization, employees use their own equipement and devices they're used to, feeling more comfortable, faster and better to work with. This also brings pros to the organization such as reducing devices and resources, etc.

Components of the BYOD policy:
- **Well-defined security policies** - Security policies and standards should be enforced over BYOD devices, some requirements:
  - Acceptable device access controls such as PINs, biometric recognition, etc.
  - Storage encryption requirements.
  - Network encryption requirements.
  - Separation of personal and organizational data.
  - Permited and forbidden applications usage.
  - Security patches.
  - Geolocation and remote security wipes.
- **Mobile Device Management Tools (MDM)** - MDM is software that streamlines the management of mobile devices. BYOD does not need of MDM, but MDM helps improve the management of BYODs. Some of the capabilities provided by MDM:
  - Enforcing security policies and standards.
  - Automated deployment of company applications.
  - Apps installing restrictions.
  - Data containerization - Dividing personal and organizational data of a BYOD for remote wipes in case of termination or device loss.
  - Device geolocation.
- **Ongoing Employee Training** - Employees should be educated on the evolutioning techniques and security measures such as:
  - Security policy awareness training.
  - Malware and phishing detection.
  - Password selection training.
  - Using VPNs and avoiding public Wi-Fi networks.
  - Handling lost or stolen devices.
