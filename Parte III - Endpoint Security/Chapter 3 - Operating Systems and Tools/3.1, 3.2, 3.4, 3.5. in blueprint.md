In this specific chapter we'll find:

3.1. Describe operating system security concepts. 
3.2. Demonstrate familiarity with appropriate endpoint tools that gather security assessment information. 
3.4. Implement software and hardware updates. 
3.5. Interpret system logs.

# Host Security Features
- For a good security on hosts, we must add a well-layered defense-in-depth model to our systems, so it doesnt rely on a single point, which would add a point of failure.
- From the broadest level, we can implemend network-wide technical control and business-wide security policies. From the perspective of the hosts, secure them with any host we dispose of.
- We'll analyze the next points from the POV of Windows, Linux and Mac OS:
  - **Host-based Firewall:** Host-based firewalls are different from network-based. A host-based firewall analyzes traffic and protects the endpoint uniquely. A network-based firewall protect traffic at the boundaries, but it can't protect endpoint devices within a subnet or devices that roam in a network. A host-based firewall is able to, though.
  - **Command-line Interface:** A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based shell that provides an administrator with numerous tools that are unavailable in graphical interfaces.
  - **File System Permissions:** File System Permissions ditactes what actions are permitted and what actions are not based on a user-by-user or group-by-group basis. With this, the principle of least privilege is important as everyone in a group only has access specifically to what they need.
  - **Full-disk Encryption:** FDE is a potent confidentiality control that wraps stored data in encrypted data. It takes plaintext and transforms it to cipertext. By doing this, any possible unauthorized individual with physical access to the storage disk also needs to have a symmetric key to decrypt the data.
  - **Update Mechanisms:** By applying update mechanisms to hosts, these hosts are supplied with security updates and patches that often helps with a devices security health, performance issues and even though it's doesn't stop there, it makes attackers job more difficult.
  - **Log Data:** Stores logs of operating system events, with a proper data log system it's possible to have a fast troubleshooting response, security ammendments and monitoring.

# Windows
- Windows is a closed-source code operating system sold and maintained by Microsoft.
- There are several editions of Windows, including host-directed versions such as Microsoft Home, Pro, Enterprise all on 10 and 11 versions; or a bit more of a professional side of things with Microsoft Server 2016 and 2019.
- There are security features that are only available on the Server side of Windows such as Active Directory.
- Also, between host-directed Windows editions, the BitLocker function is only available on Windows Pro, Education and Enterprise.
  
### Workgroups and Domains
- **Workgroup** provides a mechanism to share files and printers between endpoints. The drawback is that the workgroup feature is peer-to-peer, only devices knowing each other are able to contact. Upon Windows installation, a default workgroup is created called WORKGROUP, which within a small network can be modified with a user credential to connect to other devices.
- **Active Directory** at the other side provides client/server architecture. At their core are on-premises and cloud-based domain controllers. These servers centrally manage authorization, authentication and machine and user configurations (via Group Policies) and additionally, domain controllers use these services to obtain time syncronization and DNS. 
  - Active Directory has two main strong advantages, manageability and scalability. It offers manageability in the way that it puts configurations in a single place, the domain controller, and every connecting device obtains this certain configuration upon connection. It offers scalability in which for new additions, it's not hard for the new endpoints to get this configuration.

## Windows Defender
- Defender is a constellation of security features that helps the defending of Windows. Following, the key terms that outlights the most.

### Virus and Threat Protection
- In this section of the Windows Defender, you can see the history of previous scans performed. Also, you can schedule new ones and see the removed files under suspicious detection. It includes the following important tools:
  - The Scan Option allows you to perform new scans, more intensive ones or offline scans.
  - The Manage Settings allows you to toggle features like real-time protection and automatic sample submission.
  - The Check for Updates allows you to manually update malware signatures.

### Firewall and Network Protection
- In this tab, you can find configuration about the firewall and in which type of group and network you're currently operating at.
- Useful links in this section:
  - Allow an App Through Firewall allows you to choose whether an app should communicate in a public, private or domain network.
  - Advanced Settings allows you to choose more granular options over the network.

### App and Browser Control
- This section contains security options about Edge sandboxing, mitigation of malware and SmartScreen. In this tab, this group limits the reachability of applications inside an environment.
- SmartScreen uses reputational data about URLs and with this, define the trustyworthness and availability of URLs. SmartScreen can block low reputation files and applications, URLs (when using Edge) and other security features.
